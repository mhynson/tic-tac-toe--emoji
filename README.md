## Why build this?

For starters, its cool points with the kids, especially the youngest. Beyond that, this project is intended to demonstrate my ability and understanding of the using NextJS, ReactJS, Tailwind, and yarn (and package management in general). If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please don't hesitate to reach out!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
